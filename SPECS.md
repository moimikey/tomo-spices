# Technical Specs for Tomo Spice Blend Take Home Challenge

## Overview

This is a single page React application that allows users to view and manage spice blends. The application is built with React and uses React Router for navigation. The application is styled with Tailwind CSS. The application is built with Vite.

## Requirements

For each spice. We need to accomplish the following items:

### Functional

- [ ] Blend details page correctly lists the name of all included spices on first load.
- [ ] State management between pages, so as not to re-request data.
- [ ] Load a "blend of blend" (2nd, or 3rd blend) listing all spices included in that blend and child blends.
- [ ] Add new blend of blend to DB (form)
- [ ] One unit test.
- [ ] One new "feature" or "refactor" that shows what you consider to be your FE strengths
- [ ] One new "architecture pattern", or least be prepared to talk about one you'd like to add.

### Non-Functional

- [ ] Use React Query to manage data fetching and caching.
- [ ] Use React Context to manage state between pages.
- [ ] Use React Router to manage navigation between pages.
- [ ] Use React Hooks to manage state and side effects.
- [ ] Use React Suspense to manage loading states.
- [ ] Use React Error Boundaries to manage error handling.
- [ ] Use React Memo to manage memoization.

### User Journey

1. User navigates to the home page.
2. User sees a list of spices.
3. User clicks on a spice to view the spice details.
4. User sees the spice details.
